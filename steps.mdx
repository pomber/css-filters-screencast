<Video src="1.mp4" start={0} end={8} />
<Browser loadUrl="/1.html" />
<Editor code="1" focus="1:2,11:13" />

```srt
0 -> 9
We can apply several graphical
effects to any HTML element
using the filter CSS property
```

---

<Video src="2.mp4" start={0} end={5} />
<Browser loadUrl="/2.html" />
<Editor code="2" focus="10:12,14" />

```srt
0 -> 7
For example, we can blur an h1
using the blur function
```

---

<Video src="3.mp4" start={0} end={4} />
<Browser loadUrl="/3.html" />
<Editor code="3" focus="10:14,16" />

```srt
0 -> 5
Or, add a shadow using drop-shadow
```

---

<Video src="3.1.mp4" start={0} end={6} />
<Browser loadUrl="/3.1.html" />
<Editor code="3.1" focus="12:22" />

```srt
0 -> 8
Here are the ten different functions
that you can use and also combine
```

---

<Video src="4.mp4" start={0} end={9} />
<Browser loadUrl="/4.html" />
<Editor code="4" focus="10:12" />

```srt
0 -> 6
But there's one additional function,
which by itself doesn't do anything
6 -> 10
It takes an id as an argument
```

---

<Video src="5.mp4" start={0} end={13} />
<Browser loadUrl="/5.html" />
<Editor code="5" focus="10:12,14:18" />

```srt
0 -> 5
And to apply the effect
we need an SVG filter with that id
5 -> 15
SVG filters are much more
powerful than CSS filters,
but they are also more complicated
```

---

<Video src="6.mp4" start={0} end={12} />
<Browser loadUrl="/6.html" />
<Editor code="6" focus="10:12,14:26" />

```srt
0 -> 5
There are many primitives that you
can compose to make advanced effects
5 -> 13
Here's an example combining
two of those primitives
```
