We can use the filter CSS property to change how an element looks.

---

For example, we can blur it.

---

Or add a shadow.

---

One special filter we can use is the URL function.

I takes an id as an argument. That's the id of an svg filter.

---

Somewhere on our html we need an svg element with a filter. And that filter should have the id from the css.

---

We can use the SVG filter to apply a basic effect, like a blur.

---

Or we can have something very complex combining several effects.

---

We are going to focus on the point light effect.

---

///

We can apply several of graphical effects to any HTML element using the filter CSS property.

---

For example, we can blur an h1 using the blur function.

---

Or, add a shadow using the drop-shadow function.

---

Here are the ten different functions that you can use and combine.

---

But there's one additional function, which by itself doesn't do anything.

It takes an id as an argument.

---

And too apply the effect we need an SVG filter with that id.

SVG filters are much more powerful than the CSS filters, but they are also more complicated.

---

There are many primitives that you can compose to make advanced effects.

Here's an example combining two of those primitives.

---

<Video src="1.mp4" start={0} end={8} />
<Browser loadUrl="/1.html" />
<Editor code="1" />

```srt
0 -> 9
We can apply several graphical
effects to any HTML element
using the filter CSS property
```

---

<Video src="2.mp4" start={0} end={5} />
<Browser loadUrl="/2.html" />
<Editor code="2" />

```srt
0 -> 7
For example, we can blur an h1
using the blur function
```

---

<Video src="3.mp4" start={0} end={4} />
<Browser loadUrl="/3.html" />
<Editor code="3" />

```srt
0 -> 5
Or, add a shadow using drop-shadow
```

---

<Video src="3.1.mp4" start={0} end={6} />
<Browser loadUrl="/3.1.html" />
<Editor code="3.1" />

```srt
0 -> 8
Here are the ten different functions
that you can use and combine
```

---

<Video src="4.mp4" start={0} end={9} />
<Browser loadUrl="/4.html" />
<Editor code="4" />

```srt
0 -> 6
But there's one additional function,
which by itself doesn't do anything
6 -> 10
It takes an id as an argument
```
